# clyppi
A modern reincarnation of Clippy from the old Microsoft Word for Android; he keeps you on-task when you open procrastination apps like Facebook with a series of countdown warning messages, culminating in an audio cue.  Users can customize by blacklisting apps that they want to stay off of.  Future developments include more contextually-aware messages and more interaction possibilities.
